##Project conclusionDuring my scientific visit I got new ideas that I can develop into new scientific concepts that can be published in strong scientific journals in collaboration with PML and IOF scientists and in this way strengthen the scientific field of remote sensing that no one is engaged in at the IOF. I was invited as a visiting scientist to come to the PML again, under which I would be fully funded by the PML.In future applications for scientific projects to be undertaken by PML, the IOF will be able to be a support partner for this part of the Mediterranean Sea.
