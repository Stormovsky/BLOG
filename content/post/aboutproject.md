#### Summary

Particle transport has been found crucial for proper reproduction of marine
ecology processes. Lagrangian methods are the state-of-the-art tool in describing
dynamics of the ocean particles, still absent in applications to the Adriatic Sea, in
particular regarding plankton transport.
The aim of this proposal is to establish cooperation by young Croatian
scientist with top-level scientist from Plymouth Marine Laboratory through
learning on marine applications of their trajectory model. The learning will be
executed through model applications to the Adriatic processes, ending to a
knowledge about timescales over which surface currents are connecting different
regions in a basin. A combination of multiyear
simulations with novel Lagrangian connectivity tools will be used in studying
transport success of in different environmental conditions. Trends obtained by
modelling will be compared with trends from long time series of biological
measurements. The matching of modelled and measured trends would enable to
quantify adjustment of different plankton species to environmental changes and
variations of plankton pathways during climate changes and shifts in ocean and
atmosphere. Once validated, the new connectivity methods are planned to become
basis for new approach to plankton sampling, where sampling locations are going
to be chosen taking into account modelled connectivity.
